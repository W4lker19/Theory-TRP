### Introduction to Private Data Mining

**The Problem:**
Multiple parties want to collaboratively perform data mining tasks (classification, clustering, association rules) without revealing their private datasets to each other.

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Medical Research:** Hospitals collaborate on disease prediction models without sharing patient records
- **Financial Fraud Detection:** Banks jointly detect fraud patterns without revealing customer data
- **Marketing Analytics:** Companies analyze market trends without exposing customer databases
- **Genomic Research:** Research institutions study genetic patterns while protecting individual privacy

**Privacy Requirements:**
1. **Input Privacy:** Raw data remains confidential
2. **Computation Privacy:** Intermediate results are not disclosed
3. **Output Privacy:** Only agreed-upon results are revealed
4. **Pattern Privacy:** Sensitive patterns within data are protected

### Private Classification

**Problem Setup:**
- Party A has training data (X_A, y_A)
- Party B has training data (X_B, y_B)
- Goal: Train classifier on combined data without data sharing
- Result: Both parties get the trained model

**Naive Bayes Classification:**
SMC-friendly due to its additive nature:

```python
class PrivateNaiveBayes:
    def __init__(self, num_parties):
        self.parties = num_parties
        self.feature_counts = {}
        self.class_counts = {}
        
    def secure_training(self, local_datasets):
        # Step 1: Each party computes local statistics
        local_stats = []
        for party_data in local_datasets:
            stats = self.compute_local_statistics(party_data)
            local_stats.append(stats)
            
        # Step 2: Securely aggregate statistics using SMC
        global_feature_counts = self.secure_sum(
            [stats['feature_counts'] for stats in local_stats]
        )
        global_class_counts = self.secure_sum(
            [stats['class_counts'] for stats in local_stats]
        )
        
        # Step 3: Compute probabilities from aggregated counts
        self.feature_probabilities = self.compute_probabilities(
            global_feature_counts, global_class_counts
        )
        
        return self.feature_probabilities
```

### Private Clustering

**K-Means Clustering:**
Iterative algorithm suitable for SMC adaptation:

```python
class PrivateKMeans:
    def __init__(self, k, max_iterations=100):
        self.k = k
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        
    def secure_clustering(self, distributed_datasets):
        # Step 1: Initialize centroids (can be done publicly)
        centroids = self.initialize_centroids(self.k)
        
        for iteration in range(self.max_iterations):
            # Step 2: Assign points to clusters (locally)
            assignments = []
            for dataset in distributed_datasets:
                local_assignments = self.assign_to_clusters(dataset, centroids)
                assignments.append(local_assignments)
                
            # Step 3: Securely compute new centroids
            new_centroids = self.secure_update_centroids(
                distributed_datasets, assignments
            )
            
            # Step 4: Check convergence
            if self.has_converged(centroids, new_centroids):
                break
                
            centroids = new_centroids
            
        return centroids, assignments
```

### Federated Learning vs SMC

**Federated Learning:**
- Participants train local models and share model updates
- Central server aggregates updates to create global model
- Provides some privacy but vulnerable to inference attacks

**SMC for Machine Learning:**
- No model updates are shared in the clear
- All computations done under encryption or secret sharing
- Stronger privacy guarantees but higher computational cost

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Federated Learning | SMC-based ML |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Privacy** | Model updates visible | All computation private |
| **Efficiency** | High | Lower (crypto overhead) |
| **Communication** | Model-size dependent | Data-size dependent |
| **Trust** | Requires trusted aggregator | Fully distributed |
| **Inference Attacks** | Vulnerable | Resistant |

        return output_shares
```

**3. Hybrid Approaches:**
```python
def hybrid_nn_protocol(layers):
    for layer in layers:
        if layer.type == "linear":

        elif layer.type == "activation":
            result = garbled_circuits_compute(layer)
        elif layer.type == "pooling":
            result = homomorphic_compute(layer)
    return result
```

<details>
<summary><b>Question 3:</b> Design a secure protocol for collaborative outlier detection across multiple datasets. What are the key privacy and utility considerations? (Click to reveal answer)</summary>

**Answer:** 

**Secure Collaborative Outlier Detection Protocol:**

**Problem Setup:**
- Multiple organizations have datasets with similar structure
- Want to detect outliers that appear anomalous across all datasets
- Each organization's data must remain private
- Goal: Identify global outliers without revealing local patterns

**Protocol Design:**

**Phase 1: Secure Statistic Computation**
```python
class SecureOutlierDetection:
    def __init__(self, participants, threshold=2.0):
        self.participants = participants
        self.threshold = threshold  # Standard deviations for outlier
        
    def compute_global_statistics(self):
        # Step 1: Each party computes local statistics
        local_stats = []
        for participant in self.participants:
            stats = participant.compute_local_stats()  # mean, variance, count
            local_stats.append(stats)
            
        # Step 2: Securely aggregate statistics
        total_count = secure_sum([s['count'] for s in local_stats])
        
        # Secure computation of global mean
        weighted_means = []
        for stats in local_stats:
            weighted_mean = secure_multiply(stats['mean'], stats['count'])
            weighted_means.append(weighted_mean)
        global_mean = secure_divide(secure_sum(weighted_means), total_count)
        
        return global_mean, global_variance
```

**Privacy Considerations:**
1. **Statistical Privacy:** Add noise to protect individual contributions
2. **Pattern Privacy:** Group similar outliers to prevent identification
3. **Individual vs. Global Privacy:** Different guarantees for records vs. organizations

**Utility Considerations:**
1. **Detection Accuracy:** Balance privacy noise with detection effectiveness
2. **Statistical Utility:** Preserve meaningful statistical properties
3. **Real-time vs. Batch:** Different latency and privacy requirements

<details>
<summary><b>Question 4:</b> How would you handle the challenge of training deep neural networks using SMC? What are the bottlenecks and potential solutions? (Click to reveal answer)</summary>

**Answer:** 

**Deep Neural Network SMC Challenges:**

**1. Scale and Complexity:**
- **Problem:** Modern DNNs have millions/billions of parameters
- **SMC Impact:** Each parameter requires secure computation
- **Bottleneck:** Memory and computation grow linearly with model size

**2. Non-linear Activations:**
- **Problem:** ReLU, sigmoid, tanh are expensive in SMC
- **Traditional Cost:** O(1) per activation
- **SMC Cost:** O(log n) for comparison-based or O(n) for polynomial approximation

**Solutions and Optimizations:**

**1. Activation Function Approximations:**
```python
def secure_relu_polynomial(self, x):
    # Approximate ReLU with degree-3 polynomial
    abs_x = self.secure_absolute_value_approx(x)
    return self.secure_multiply(0.5, self.secure_add(x, abs_x))
```

**2. Hybrid Computation Approaches:**
```python
class HybridSecureDNN:
    def __init__(self, public_layers, private_layers):
        self.public_layers = public_layers    # Can be computed in clear
        self.private_layers = private_layers  # Must be computed securely
        
    def hybrid_training(self, data_shares):
        # Phase 1: Public feature extraction
        public_features = self.extract_public_features(data_shares)
        
        # Phase 2: Secure private computation
        private_features = self.secure_private_layers(public_features)
        
        # Phase 3: Public classification head
        final_output = self.public_classification(private_features)
        
        return final_output
```

**3. Model Architecture Optimizations:**
- Minimize non-linear activations
- Use wider layers instead of deeper networks
- Avoid normalization layers when possible
- Knowledge distillation from larger teacher models

**Current Limitations:**
- Deep networks with >1M parameters are impractical with current SMC
- Training time scales poorly with model complexity
- Limited to simple architectures and approximations

<details>
<summary><b>Question 5:</b> Explain the relationship between federated learning and differential privacy. How can they be combined for stronger privacy guarantees? (Click to reveal answer)</summary>

**Answer:** 

**Federated Learning Privacy Vulnerabilities:**
- **Gradient Leakage:** Model updates can leak information about training data
- **Inference Attacks:** Adversaries can infer membership, attributes, or even reconstruct data
- **Honest-but-Curious Servers:** Central aggregator sees all model updates

**How Differential Privacy Strengthens Federated Learning:**

**1. Local Differential Privacy (LDP) in FL:**
```python
class DPFederatedLearning:
    def __init__(self, epsilon_local, epsilon_global):
        self.epsilon_local = epsilon_local    # Local DP budget per client
        self.epsilon_global = epsilon_global  # Global DP budget for aggregation
        
    def client_update_with_ldp(self, local_model, local_data, learning_rate):
        # Standard gradient computation
        gradients = self.compute_gradients(local_model, local_data)
        
        # Add noise to gradients (Local DP)
        noisy_gradients = []
        for grad in gradients:
            sensitivity = self.compute_gradient_sensitivity(grad)
            noise = self.laplace_noise(sensitivity / self.epsilon_local)
            noisy_gradients.append(grad + noise)
            
        return updated_model, noisy_gradients
```

**2. Advanced Composition:**
- **Moments Accountant:** Provides tighter bounds than basic composition
- **R√©nyi Differential Privacy:** Better composition for iterative algorithms
- **Adaptive Noise Scheduling:** Allocate privacy budget optimally across rounds

**3. Client-Level Differential Privacy:**
```python
class ClientLevelDP:
    def __init__(self, epsilon_per_client, max_participation):
        self.epsilon_per_client = epsilon_per_client
        self.max_participation = max_participation
        
    def allocate_privacy_budget(self, client_id, round_number):
        remaining_rounds = self.max_participation - self.participation_counts[client_id]
        round_epsilon = self.epsilon_per_client / remaining_rounds
        return round_epsilon
```

**Benefits of DP-FL Combination:**
- **Formal Privacy Guarantees:** Mathematical bounds on privacy loss
- **Defense Against Inference Attacks:** Protection beyond just gradient hiding
- **Flexible Privacy-Utility Trade-offs:** Tunable parameters for different needs
- **Composition Properties:** Can reason about privacy across multiple training runs

**Challenges:**
- **Utility Degradation:** Additional noise reduces model accuracy
- **Complex Parameter Tuning:** Many hyperparameters to optimize
- **Implementation Complexity:** Requires expertise in both FL and DP
